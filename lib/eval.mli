(** Top-level expression evaluator and value-to-int conversion.

    The full struct-internal expression machinery (with [Ref]/[Sizeof_this]/
    [Field_pos] resolution against bound fields) lives in {!Codec} as the
    [compile_int_arr] family, which compiles expressions to [int array]
    accessors at codec construction. This module is the residual evaluator for
    the {!Wire.of_string}/{!Wire.encode} paths, which only ever evaluate
    expressions in {!empty}: no field references, no cross-field dependencies.
*)

type ctx
(** Top-level evaluation context. Used by [Byte_array_where]'s per-element
    refinement, which binds the element variable to the byte value before
    evaluating its constraint. Cross-field state lives in [Codec]'s int-array
    machinery; at top level the binding is empty unless explicitly extended. *)

val empty : ctx
(** Empty context — no bindings. *)

val bind : string -> int -> ctx -> ctx
(** [bind name v ctx] extends [ctx] so that [Ref name] evaluates to [v]. *)

val int_of : 'a Types.typ -> 'a -> int option
(** [int_of typ v] converts a typed value to [int]. Returns [None] for types
    that don't fit in OCaml int (uint64 > 2^62, non-numeric). *)

val expr : ctx -> 'a Types.expr -> 'a
(** [expr ctx e] evaluates a top-level expression. Raises on [Ref] (cross-field
    references are only valid inside a struct). [Sizeof_this] and [Field_pos]
    return 0. *)
